            <h1>Hi, It's <span>Ilham</span></h1>
            <h3 class="text-animation">I'm a <span></span></h3>
            <p>I am currently a student at PENS (Politeknik Elektronika Negeri Surabaya), 
                pursuing a degree in Informatics Engineering in the D3 PJJ program. 
                My academic journey has not only helped me build a solid foundation in programming and technology but has also sparked my passion for web development. 
                Alongside my studies, I work as a UI/UX designer, where I focus on crafting intuitive user interfaces that enhance the overall experience for users. Additionally, I am developing my skills as a Junior Front-end Developer, working with modern technologies like HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap to bring creative designs to life and build responsive websites. With a strong interest in both design and development, I am committed to bridging the gap between aesthetics and functionality in digital products.
